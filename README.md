- **Polymorphism**: Interface implementations and method overriding
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

### Running the Projects

Each module contains a main class that can be executed independently:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd oop-a/src

# Compile and run individual modules
javac TheGoldenBucket/*.java
java TheGoldenBucket.TheGoldenBucketRestaurant

javac CrazyStation/*.java
java CrazyStation.CrazyStation

javac NeedForSpeed/*.java
java NeedForSpeed.NeedForSpeed

# And so on for other modules...
```

### Testing

Several modules include test classes:
- `ListImplTest.java` - Tests for custom list implementation
- `LinkedListImpTest.java` - Tests for linked list implementation
- `TitanicAnalysenTest.java` - Tests for Titanic analysis methods

Run tests using your IDE's test runner or compile and execute manually.
